          <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
          <ul id="inside_content">
            <li id="list_items">Variable Declaration:</li><p> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variables holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called indentifiers. var x;</h4>
            <li id="list_items">Variable Assignment:</li><p> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.  The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;</h4>
            <li>Data Types: Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate an variables you need to know the data type.  There are six data types that are JavaScript primitive: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - [1, 'Coding',2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</h4>
            <li>Condtionals: When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decsions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statments in your to accomplish this.  There are the following  conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, id the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code.</h4>
            <li>Loops: There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  Thats a loop!</h4>
            <li>Function: Functions are an encaspulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</h4>
